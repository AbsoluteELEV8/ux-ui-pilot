> After ANY correction from the user, record the pattern here. Review at session start.

## How to Use This File

1. When the user corrects you, immediately add an entry below
2. Include: what went wrong, why, and the rule to prevent recurrence
3. Review this file at the start of every session
4. Patterns that repeat should become `.cursor/rules/` entries
